Introduction
This analysis takes a look at the factors of the housing market in the Seattle area. I've created a model to predict the price of a home given certain characteristics.

Analysis
Data exploration was first, followed by some comparisons between variables utilizing heatmaps and histograms, and finally building and training a model.

Conclusion
The model returned a respectable outcome with a relatively well organized regression line yielding a 66% r-squared
